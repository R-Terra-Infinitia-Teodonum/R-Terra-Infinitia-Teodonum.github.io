		<h2 class = "center">Latin</h2>
		<p>Latin is a beautiful language to use. There are many recent methods of teaching Latin. The only one that is decent is the textbook: ”Lingua Latina per se Illustrata”.</p>
		<p>Collar and Daniel’s Latin is the textbook I used, thanks to the one that inspired me to learn Latin, Luke Smith.</p>
		<p>Another great textbook I have looked over that has a community on Textkit is De L’Ooge’s Latin.</p>
		<p>Both are great. Whichever you will try, if you do choose to begin the study of this language, there are great benefits for your CONSISTENCE.</p>
		<p>Medieval books such as the beginner-friendly Etymologies of Isidore of Seville, an early medieval collection of all of Rome’s wisdom, covering topics from herbs and Anatomy to languages and Dialectics and Geography.</p>
		<p>It can be found on lindypress.net and bought as a physical copy.</p>
		<p>There are other books from endless authors that become available to you. (Search ”The Latin Library”.)</p>
		<p>Latin can be the first step to a career in Linguistics, the study of how love is made manifest.</p>
		<p>It can be the gateway, raising your confidence, previous to your going deeper, and studying Ancient Greek, Sanskrit, or Proto-Indo-European.</p>
		<p>If you are looking to follow a career in Law or become literate in legalese, etymology is the cornerstone.</p>
		<p>Most of the time, English words, particularly Commerce and Law words, come from Latin.</p>
		<p>E.g. corp-oration, made up of ”corpus, corporis” and ”oratio, orationis”.</p>
		Corpus means ”body”, but a body without a soul, ”anima”, as in ”anime, animation”, is a dead body. A ”corpse”.</p>
		<p>To be an orator, as in ”oration”, is to be great speaker.</p>
		<p>So, corp-oration means, basically, ”dead body speak”.</p>
		<p>A corporation has no life of it’s own. Facebook can’t show up in court. Mark Zuckerberg can. This becomes important when you study corporate contracts, which we sign whenever your name appears in all capital letters. For more on this, Aaron Abke has a great series called The Rabbit Hole.</p>
		<p>The word ”corporation” illustrates how much corporations have no power, only men, who are born, in fact, equal to us.</p>
		<p>This simple word and study of etymology can lead us to challenge authority.</p>
		<p>To those who want you think Latin ”hard!” and laws ”weird!” this is checkmate!</p>
		</br>
		<p>Remember, if you venture into the study of Latin, study at least once a day, preferably in the morning.</p>
		<p>It is important that you spend at least half an hour, preferably an hour, or as long as a lesson takes, every day, studying Latin.</p>
		<p>This will ensure your success more than anything, and allow you to develop reading skills for the language...</p>
		</br>
		<p>Remember to do the reading exercises, by the way.</p>
