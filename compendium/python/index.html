		<p>The last programming language we will touch on, if you want to learn Python, there is a lovely series on it on the channel Telsuko.</p>
		<p>As you follow the series, if you want to get more of a taste of programming, which is usually what Python gives people, you should play with Pygame and try writing some code people have put up online in game-making series.</p>
		<p>Just, if you’re little and rading this, remember that if you show it to your parents as if it’s self-made, the satisfaction != the only way to code, and you will not learn a lot doing this you are not truly learning, probably! Pride is unintelligent!</p>
		<p>At least modify it, my friend! Then it’s an original fan fiction, not a copy!</p>
		</br>
		<p>If you are competent enough to read a book on Python, I will still recommend it to you - of course - to try the C programming language.</p>
