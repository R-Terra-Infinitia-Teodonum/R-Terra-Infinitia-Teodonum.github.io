		<h2 class = "center">Linux</h2>
		<p>Opensuse is my favorite pick for beginners, Debian for severs, Gentoo for fun and tortur[ous learning], and Arch Linux for use, being really easy to install a GUI (Graphical User Interface) on thanks to Luke Smith’s larbs.sh script which can be found on larbs.xyz.</p>
		<p>Luke Smith also has a great video on installing Arch Linux, making the installation as easy as Opensuse’s!</p>
		<p>So, Arch is, thanks to Luke, great if you want to play with custom Linux without customizing yourself, at least for a start...</p>
