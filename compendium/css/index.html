		<p>My first recommendation for leaning CSS would be Kevin Powell.</p>
		<p>Besides, there are many websites teaching CSS tricks and tips for when you could use an idea, however Kevin is the only one to have a proper website with courses, some of which are free, that teaches you CSS, and he is the only one to teach CSS in such a simple and fun way.</p>
		<p>His willingness to call himself a CSS evangelist should certainly also win a few points, thus I call Kevin Powell the number one CSS hero!</p>
