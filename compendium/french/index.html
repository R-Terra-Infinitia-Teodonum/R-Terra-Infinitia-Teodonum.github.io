		<p>French can be learnt well-enough with the Michel Thomas tapes, with Duolingo aaiding your pronounciation.</p>
		<p>Then, you can practice speaking French to yourself and viewing the world in French colors - a new perspective.</p>
		<p>This happens to be what anyone that becomes good at a language does, getting good at having a *mode* of yourself in x language.</p>
		<p>Pronunciation also matters! For French, you may find a French channel you like to act as your role *model* after a week or two on Duolingo</p>
