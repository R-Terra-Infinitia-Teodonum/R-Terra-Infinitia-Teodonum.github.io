		<p>The C Programming Language can easily be learnt for beginners with Caleb Curry's series for it, however if you want to get an in-depth look, you may want to look at the book [on which the series is based]: Programming in C: An Introduction to The C Programming Language. In C Programming circles you will find mention of a book titled "The C Programming Language", spoken of as a bible, so if that's the case, it is the Old Testament, while this book is the New Testament of Jesus. It is a most amazing book you can use to fully learn about the uses of the language. The book can be found on libgen.is.</p>
		<p>The allegro5 library is a great game-making library that anyone can use with ease on Linux by searching the installation and usage instructions.</p>
		<p>I was able to learn it and make my first game in less than a week without great experience with C - purely passion and curiosity and a great library I love...</p>
		<p>For my fellow old MacOS version users - something I temporarily have been by an amusing twist of events - if you want to make a game, make it in Javascript.</p>
