		<p>Hebrew can be learnt with hebrewpodcasts.com, hebrewpodcasts on YouTube. Follow it for a few lessons and you wonâ€™t want to stop.</p>
		<p>For extra motivation and inspiration to do more every day, watch these songs: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUDbDgQCefKFTvrO2sLr9EkBWS44Ps5ODfeature=shared</p>
		<p>Have fun!</p>
		<p>As for ancient Hebrew, there are also some great channels on it, I believe.</p>
		</br>
		<p>Probably.</p>
		<p>Ask God, and he shall help you!</p>
