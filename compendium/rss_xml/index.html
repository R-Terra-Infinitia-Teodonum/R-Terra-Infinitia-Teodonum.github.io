		<p>RSS is easy to learn about. Just search "rss luke smith" on YouTube, or "RSS Luke Smith" if you want to be proper, either way it works.</p>
		<p>My dream is that we will one day, like in this video, <a href = "https://youtu.be/S1WQlr42xDM?feature=shared">A simple shell script for a Blog & RSS feed</a>, or like i once made a shell script in early 8th grade to act as an Excel alternative because I didn't know about the Linux alternative, and didn't want to use non-free software, we can one day make a script for anyone to be able to run an RSS feed to replace Twitter, Instagram, and other stupid platforms. As for the discussion part, I hope it should be done within what I call "DCIs", Dynamic Community Interfaces, which I hope should replace "Socials".</p>
		<p>This is a bright future for RSS, where it is used as the basis for programs that replace "Socials" with a simple newspaper-like format you can discuss. - Ah, yes, where?</p>
		<p>A Dynamic Community Interface is dynamic in that it is real, raw, and valuable, rather than being fake, disingenious and based in social looks rater than kindness and you, and never actually providing value. There is basically no integrity promoted on "Socials", only a social game, as further indicated by the anger and control we see on "Social Media", influencers telling us everything they think, and more distortions that are quite stupid of human behavior, which provide us 0 benefits!</p>
		<p>Yes. 0!</p>
		</br>
		<p>I have found XML can be learnt rather easily, plus there are many documentations on it. It is the primary vehicle used for RSS feeds, so if you use them, you should learn XML pretty easily!</p>
