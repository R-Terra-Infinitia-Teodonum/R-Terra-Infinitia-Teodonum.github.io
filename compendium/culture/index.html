		<h2 class = "center">Culture</h2>
		<p>We begin our discussion of human culture by looking at the rough cultural distinctions of West and East.</p>
		<p>The West tends to be about individual empowerment whilst the East is about taking responsability for the happienss of others, often because of a feeling of debt to others, which is confused for love.</p>
		<p>This leads to bitterness often, and is generally the root of the ”pajeet” archetype.</p>
		<p>In the west, our self-centeredness is more often about greed and personal gain at the expense of others.</p>
		<p>Both Eastern and Western are not wrong, and both are often under the illusion that love that there isn't enough love for both me and others, everyone, always, and that it's mutual exchange only, and when someone has nothing to give in exchange both get manipulative.</p>
		<p>Both are learning the value of people's kindness being about them, rather than overworking, or some other forced matter... Also known as liberty.</p>
		</br>
		<p>I will besides this note leave studying cultures to the endless opinions and talks out there.</p>
		<p>There is a particular African culture I find interesting which attempts to talk to a baby’s soul before they are born so as to find how to best guide the child on their journey.</p>
		<p>So many interesting cultures around the world.</p>
		<p>You may watch Geography Now’s videos about a particular country for an introduction to that country, or a few travel vlogs!</p>
