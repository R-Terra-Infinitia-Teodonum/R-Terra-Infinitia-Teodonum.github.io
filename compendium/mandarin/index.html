		<p>You can use the ideas we used for Japanese kanji to study Chinese characters, just read up on Heisig’s method from Remembering The Kanji 1, and read the notes in later chapters after you’ve tried for a bit, and apply the ideas.</p>
		<p>Perhaps one day someone will compile a guide like Remembering The Kanji 1 for Chinese that is well-organized, but until then, you’ll have to do it yourself if you want quick studying without repeat memorization, which doesn’t stick very well.</p>
		<p>Luke Smith also offers some great books you may use on his website in an article on learning Chinese.</p>
