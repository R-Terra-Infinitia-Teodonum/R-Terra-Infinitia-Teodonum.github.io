		<p>As to the study of Geography, first, for the Earthâ€™s map and features you can use the endless quizzes out there.</p>
		<p>Second, as to studying more about the Earth you can pick up a textbook on Geology, the History of Earth, and so on...</p>
		<p>I had a mini-book when I was little from which I still remember some things.</p>
		<p>Finally, for Mineralogy, you may use an encyclopedia of precious stones, stones, and minerals.</p>
		<p>It may or may not also describe to you some things about Mineralogy like the toughness of a mineral a.k.a. which mineral dents which. Diamond is the strongest.</p>
