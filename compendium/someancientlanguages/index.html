		<p>Ancient Greek, Sanskrit, Gothic: https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/other-langs/</p>
		<p>- Note: if you want to study Ancient Greek knowing only English, not only Latin, you may search on libgen.is for a textbook that is to your liking...</p>
		<p>Remember, you can’t get it wrong worse than I did, probably.</p>
		<p>I found a book specifying the detailed rules of the Greek language and wrote like crazy on the pronunciation section about elision, and all sorts of crazy poetic variations, and things, only to finish the section and realize: Oh. I don’t know how to say anything.</p>
		<p>Then I studied a chapter or two out of a proper textbook and it was like a magic, I could speak and make sentences!</p>
		Though at this point, for the time being, though I loved Greek, I wanted to try a fresh start, this time finishing a language, so I decided to focus on Latin, learning Javascript, and my tutorials website at the time, October-November
2021.</p>
		<p>— Anyhow, you can’t mess up your first try more than I did at studying Greek.</p>
		</br>
		<p>Sanskrit will be a bit hard because the Devanipravesika by Goldman and Sutherland is honestly kind of like a philosophy book.</p>
		<p>You will have to read it as if you were reading a philosophy book, if you are not an experienced language student.</p>
		</br>
		<p>This is one of the few times where it’s good to have a mediocre understanding of the author’s words at first.</p>
		<p>We call this ”data streams” in web development, where you stream data to someone’s device slowly.</p>
		</br>
		<p>I am hoping to one day see an even cooler Sanskrit method/s developed, so various people can have fun with the language and it can be adapted (the teaching).</p>
		<p>For now, you will have a more [classic] Sanskrit Learning Adventure as your best bet.</p>
		<p>You can do it!</p>
