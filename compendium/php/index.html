		<p>PHP is very useful for writing code for your website, and can be used to interact with MySQL in ways which can create dynamic - that is - interactive, and changeable by the users' actions - websites, such as forums. Though it is true that for matters such as chatrooms, as of now, NodeJS would be more used, most of all because of it's better refershing, and some other tiny things I don't remember. Something about speed, I believe.</p>
		<p>Freecodecamp has a great course on PHP on their YouTube channel.</p>
