		<p>russianforeveryone is a great resource for studying Russian, together with the many YouTube videos on the language.</p>
		<p>If I were to study Russian from the beginning now, I would get some basic Grammar down with russianforeveryone, watch videos and learn some vocabulary on YouTube, and then start playing with reading and thinking in Russian quick.</p>
		<p>The pronunciation isn’t that hard. The language you will learn easily - if this is scary to you, you’ll be fine, it’s not that much compared to Japanese or Chinese, though that too won’t be hard with the right methods...</p>
