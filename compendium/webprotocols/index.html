		<h2 class = "center">Web Protocols</h2>
		<p>Web protocols, such as http and https, which you are using to "browse", as in "browser", the Worldwide Web.</p>
		<p>Besides the worldwide web, which you have known, there are more web protocols. The old Gopher and the new Gemini simpler alternative to the modern web are such examples.</p>
		<p>It is notable that a new web protocol can, the same way http and https are created, always be made, and new naming servers for domains can also be made, though it is not necessary to do this to have a website in another protocol today.</p>
		<p>If such a move as the one previously mentioned were made, making a new protocol and new naming servers, one or the other, or both, one finds out that there is no way to stop the Intenet from freedom. All that is an illusion...</p>
		<p>Together, we can do anything, as much as some of you will hate me for saying this. Yes, friendship does have powers, even being able to create new worldwide webs. Well, that's child's play...</p>
