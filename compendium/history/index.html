		<p>As to History, there are so many channels out there today it’s amazing.</p>
		<p>For Ancient History, I would recommend History with Cy for the Near East, Historia Civilis for Ancient Roman and Greek History, and Kings and Generals for general History;</p>
		<p>For Islamic History or African History or vieos aboutan incredible amount of topics, including the best "What if the axis won WW2?" - looking into the actual axis plans if they had won World War Two - videos that are highly detailed and educational - watch Jabzy;</p>
		<p>For matters about the Napoleonic Wars or Napoleon watch Epic History;</p>
		<p>World War One or World War Two for these wars in realtime + Eastory for maps and narration;</p>
		</br>
		<p>House of History does an amazing coverage of Prussian History;</p>
		<p>There are also lovely coverages of Bismarck’s times by Real Time History;</p>
		<p>The loveliest coverage of his life though comes from Extra History, with lovely documentaries.</p>
		</br>
		<p>Let us not forget all the alternate history channels like Alternate History Hub and Whatifalthist, which provide interesting topics for you to make History projects about.</p>
		<p>When I was 12, Whatifalthist inspired me to make a project about alternate History and have the History teacher accept it, xd...</p>
		</br>
		<p>Have fun.</p>
		<p>You may also like to, one day, try out books.</p>
		<p>I promise there are some good ones out there.</p>
