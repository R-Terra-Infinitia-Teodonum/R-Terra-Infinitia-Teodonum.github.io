		<h2 class = "center">Typing Speed</h2>
		<p>Typing speed is for everyone. If you spend one day learning to use a laptop keyboard properly you will:</p>
		<p>- Gain confidence in all typing (and your whole life);</p>
		<p>- Gain the time spent many times over just for your ability to now type at any pace;</p>
		<p>- Thank yourself a lot later, over years;</p>
		<p>- Give you a skill you can use and empower you to use your laptop creatively;</p>
		<p>- Make writing things by hand rather than copying them easy forever, allowing you to write templates rather than copying them, at times, as what can be a great learning experience where you re-do the basics.</p>
		<p>All for just one day and another few getting your speed up in a new typing style that gives you TRUE COMOFRT and EFFORTLESS writing.</p>
