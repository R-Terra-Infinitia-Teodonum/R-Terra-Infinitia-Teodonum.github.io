		<p>There is so much beautiful literature and so many people to give you ideas about it and what literature you might read!</p>
		<p>My favorites, besides Japanese light novels and web novels translated so beautifully to English by communities, would have to be children’s books, such as a book from where I live called ”The Apolodor Book”, about a singer penguin from Labrador who came to Romania and missed his friends and relatives in Labrador, at home, on Gulf Terror.</p>
		<p>Though he sang and was famous he missed his friends, so he goes on an amazing adventure, and gets home, and then, he realizes he misses his friends back in Romania, and at the end, he makes his way home, realizing life with his family is lovely and so is life in Romania, and he prefers the latter.</p>
		</br>
		<p>One more book whose theme I find beautiful today is ”Parvenus of Old and New”, which introduced me to the idea of a ’parvenu’, which so succintly describes negativity.</p>
		<p>When people *parvenu* off the name of saints, of goodness, or of something kind to gain power over others. </p>
		<p>"If you don’t do this, you will burn in hell by the name of Jesus Christ!” - it is said...</p>
		<p>In that, they miss the chance to experience the very thing they are searching for —</p>
		<p>Kindness - wholeness - honesty - truth...</p>
		<p>What I just gave you is one example of how literature can change your views...</p>
		</br>
		<p>Of course, I love Harry Potter.</p>
